/*
 Delete middle element of a stack 
Easy Accuracy: 50.06% Submissions: 41611 Points: 2
Given a stack with push(), pop(), empty() operations, delete the middle of the stack without using any additional data structure.
Middle: ceil((size_of_stack+1)/2) (1-based index)
 

Example 1:

Input: 
Stack = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1, 2, 4, 5}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 5 , 
hence the middle element will be the 3rd
element which is deleted
Example 2:

Input: 
Stack = {1 2 3 4}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1 3 4}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 4 , 
hence the middle element will be the 2nd
element which is deleted
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function deleteMid() which takes the stack and its size as input parameters and modifies the stack in-place.
Note: The output shows the stack from top to bottom.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
2 ≤ size of stack ≤ 100
